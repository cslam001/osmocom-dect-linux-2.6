 *
 * A transceiver provides frame reception and transmission, signal strength
 * measurement as well as a reference clock for the MAC layer. It can exist
 * in two basic states:
 *
 * - master: doesn't need initial synchronization to a radio signal
 * - slave: needs to synchronize timing with a signal
 *
 * Only the first transceiver of a FP is a master, PPs are always slaves to
 * a FPs timing. Secondary and further transceivers of a FP also start as
 * slaves until they have synchronized to one of the already running
 * transceivers.
 *
 * Locking to a new signal works in multiple phases:
 *
 * 1) The ->enable() callback is invoked. The driver is expected to initiate a
 *    scan for a signal, during which it will pass on any received frame to the
 *    transceiver layer. As no framing has been established, all packets should
 *    indicate a slot number of zero.
 *
 * 2) While scanning for a signal, the ->set_carrier() callback may be invoked
 *    with a slot number of zero. The driver is expected to adjust the carrier
 *    on which it is scanning for a signal.
 *
 * 3) When the MAC layer determines interest in a received signal, the ->confirm()
 *    callback is invoked. The driver is expected to continue to pass frames from
 *    this signal to the MAC layer to establish framing.
 *
 * 3a) When the MAC layer is only collecting information for a scan, it may call
 *     the ->unlock callback to release a previously confirmed signal.
 *
 * 4) Once the MAC layer has determined framing relative to the slot timing, the
 *    ->lock() callback is invoked. At this point, only a single physical channel
 *    is received. The driver should synchronize the hardware to the framing to
 *    make it interrupt at the appropriate times.
